# Kotlin Studies

This project is a study of the Kotlin language, covering various of its key features. Throughout this study, concepts such as functions, generics, interfaces, objects, when, while, for, and classes will be explored.

## Covered Features

- **Functions:** Exploration of using functions in Kotlin, including higher-order functions and anonymous functions.
- **Generics:** Use of generics to create more generic and reusable code.
- **Interfaces:** Implementation and use of interfaces for defining contracts.
- **Objects:** Utilization of objects in Kotlin, including singleton objects and companion objects.
- **When:** Use of the 'when' expression to replace 'switch' or 'case' statements in Kotlin.
- **While and For:** Use of 'while' and 'for' loops for flow control and iteration in Kotlin.
